# Event - Separating JSON-LD and Data Endpoints
Matching Schema.org as closely as possible, while still representing the data in a way that is useful for the consumer. Removing the "Linked Data" aspect of JSON-LD, and focusing on the data itself.

## Data Endpoint 
```content/event/{id}```

## JSON-LD Endpoint
Providing a JSON-LD structure for partners to use to inject onto their website. This is not the same as the data endpoint, as it is not useful for database storage or API consumption. This is for partners who want to inject JSON-LD onto their website. Partners can store this JSON-LD in a field on their own database so that they can easily inject the JSON into their page.

The notion of contributor according to [Schema.org](https://schema.org) differs from LVC's database "contributor". With that in mind, to more accurately represent the content of a page using JSON-LD, the "contributor" and it's "type" of contribution will have to be assessed and represented in a way that follows the standard.

```/json-ld/event/{id}```
```json
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org",
  "@type": "Event",  // Could also be more specific (ex: MusicEvent)
  "@id": "https://la-vitrine.com/event/john-smith-show/492/23", // Only for an example of LVC Frontend injection - see notes. This would be the event page on the partner's website
  "url": "https://example.com/event-page", // Official event page webpage
  "identifier": 23,  // Not that useful for JSON-LD
  "name": "John Smith Comedy Show",
  "description": "Join us for a night of laughter with the hilarious John Smith.",
