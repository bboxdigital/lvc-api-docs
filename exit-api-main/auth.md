# Quick Start Guide: REST Open API with Standard Access Tokens

Welcome to the world of RESTful APIs! This quick start guide will help you get started with a REST Open API, utilizing standard access tokens passed through the Authorization header. Follow these steps to seamlessly integrate with the API and access its resources.

## Step 1: Obtain API Credentials

Before you start using the API, you need to obtain your API credentials, including a client ID and client secret. This information is essential for authenticating your requests.

## Step 2: Authentication

To authenticate your requests, the API uses OAuth 2.0. Obtain an access token by making a POST request to the token endpoint with your client credentials.

```http
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: api.la-vitrine.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=client_credentials&
client_id=your_client_id&
client_secret=your_client_secret
```

Replace `your_client_id` and `your_client_secret` with your actual credentials. The response will contain an access token.

```json
{
  "access_token": "your_access_token",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

## Step 3: Make API Requests

Now that you have the access token, include it in the Authorization header of your API requests.

```http
GET /resource HTTP/1.1
Host: api.la-vitrine.com
Authorization: Bearer your_access_token
```

Replace `your_access_token` with the actual access token obtained in Step 2. The server will validate the token, and if valid, respond with the requested resource.

## Step 4: Handling Errors

Be prepared to handle errors by checking the HTTP status codes and error responses provided by the API. Common status codes include 200 OK for successful requests and 401 Unauthorized for authentication issues.

## Additional Tips:

- **Token Expiry:** Access tokens typically have a limited lifespan. Monitor the `expires_in` field in the token response and refresh the token as needed.
  
- **Secure Connections:** Always use HTTPS to ensure secure communication with the API.

- **Rate Limiting:** Be aware of any rate limits imposed by the API to avoid being blocked. Check the API documentation for rate limit details.

- **API Documentation:** Refer to the API documentation for specific details on available resources, request parameters, and response formats.

Congratulations! You've successfully set up and authenticated with a REST Open API. Use this guide as a starting point and refer to the API documentation for more advanced features and customization options. Happy coding!
