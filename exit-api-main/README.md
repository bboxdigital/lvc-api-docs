# La Vitrine REST API Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the official documentation for La Vitrine Culturelle's REST API, a comprehensive interface designed to expose curated event data in Quebec to external partners. This API follows the OpenAPI standards, providing a reliable and flexible solution for accessing event-related information.

## Background

La Vitrine has long been a curator of events in Quebec, serving as a go-to source for discovering and promoting various cultural happenings. In an effort to enhance the accessibility and functionality of their services, a new RESTful API has been developed. While maintaining the essence of their existing API, significant improvements have been implemented to accommodate the evolving data structure and to introduce additional features.

## Key Features

### 1. Endpoint Overview

The API offers a set of main endpoints, allowing external partners to seamlessly fetch data from La Vitrine's extensive database. The primary endpoints include:

- **Events:** Retrieve information about individual events.
- **Contributors:** Access details about contributors associated with events.
- **Location:** Fetch data related to event venues or locations.
- **Event Query:** A versatile endpoint enabling users to perform queries across all event types.

### 2. Data Structure

Efforts have been made to align the JSON structure closely with the Schema.org standards. This not only ensures consistency but also facilitates easy adaptation to the JSON-LD format, enhancing the interoperability of the data.

### 3. JSON-LD Endpoints

For users seeking a more structured and linked representation of key content, the API offers separate JSON-LD endpoints. These endpoints provide a basic JSON-LD representation of essential information, such as event details, allowing for richer and more context-aware data consumption.

### 4. Granularity Enhancement

One of the key improvements in this API is the increased level of granularity across various fronts. La Vitrine's partners now have access to a more detailed and comprehensive dataset, empowering them with richer information for a more engaging user experience.
