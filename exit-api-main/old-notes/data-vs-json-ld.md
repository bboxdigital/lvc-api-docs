# Notes
- I think the idea behind JSON-LD as API responses is not the best approach here.
- A better approach will be to structure the response as much as possible from "Schema.org" standards (schemas and fields) so that users can inject their own JSON-LD into their page seemlessly with miminal effort and manipulation of data.
- The main API response should be stripped of any Schema.org references (ex: @content). As an exit API we want the data to be as maluable as possible, providing what is needed to users and avoid bloat. Some user may not want JSON-LDs. Some might want to create their own JSON-LD for their site based on their own requirements and needs.
- Perhaps we can have flags or separate API endpoints to return the JSON-LD format as we interpret from our side, leaving out domain specifics or links to internal pages (using @id).

- With JSON-LD, you could use seperate scripts to inject different "components" into the page. Example, you might have the main event information, then another script to hold JSON-LD for an event schedule list of events. Yes, it is best to try to connect all the data together and use one Schema, but often it's no possible, key point here is that you are not limited to one JSON-LD script per page.
